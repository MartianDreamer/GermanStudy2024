Q: what more verbs can go directly with another verb in its infinitive form like gehen?

A: Great question! In German, some verbs can be followed directly by another verb in its infinitive form without "zu". These are often modal verbs, verbs of perception, and verbs of movement.

1. Modal Verbs (always followed by an infinitive):

    * Ich kann schwimmen. (I can swim.)
    * Du musst arbeiten. (You must work.)
    * Er will tanzen. (He wants to dance.)

2. Verbs of Perception (seeing, hearing, feeling), these verbs describe what someone perceives:

    * Ich sehe ihn kommen. (I see him coming.)
    * Sie h√∂rt ihn singen. (She hears him singing.)
    * Er f√ºhlt das Wasser flie√üen. (He feels the water flowing.)

3. Verbs of Movement (going, coming, running), these verbs describe motion and are followed by an infinitive:

    * Ich gehe einkaufen. (I go shopping.)
    * Er kommt essen. (He comes to eat.)
    * Sie l√§uft schwimmen. (She runs to swim.)

4. "Lassen" (to let, to allow), "Lassen" is often followed by an infinitive:

    * Ich lasse ihn schlafen. (I let him sleep.)
    * Sie l√§sst das Kind spielen. (She lets the child play.)
